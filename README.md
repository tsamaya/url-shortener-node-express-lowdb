# url-shortener-node-express-lowdb

This is a simple Proof of Concept to create an URL shortener.

### Get started

- clone or fork this repository
- `$ cd /path/to/repo`
- `$ npm install`
- `$ npm start`

then open your browser on http://localhost:3000

### Limits

`lowdb` is a convenient method for storing data without setting up a database server. It is fast enough and safe to be used as an embedded database.

However, if you seek high performance and scalability more than simplicity, you should probably stick to traditional databases like` MongoDB`.
